# Chat Me

A simple chatting web application create with `Express.js`, `Socket.io` and `MongoDB`.

## Features

- Responsive UI
- Realtime chat
- Session based authentication

## Backend

- `Express.js` for the backend
- `Socket.io` for the realtime communication
- `MongoDB` and `Mongoose` to store chat messages

## Frontend

Since I want to reduce the debugging of `CORS` errors, and focus on the backend, I chose the `Alpine.js` for the reactivity. 

- `Alpine.js` a Vue js like library, which is small, lightweight and easy to use. Instead of Vue attributes such as `v-for`, `v-if`, Alpine use `x-for` and `x-if` and so on.
- `Tailwind CSS` for eye catching styling.
